## 📊 Test Data Structure

The component supports both live API data (FakeStore API) and custom test data:

```javascript
{
  id: 'unique-id',
  title: 'Product Name',
  description: 'Product description...',
  price: 99.99,
  originalPrice: 129.99, // Optional for discounts
  image: 'primary-image.jpg',
  images: ['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg'], // For carousel
  category: 'electronics',
  rating: { rate: 4.5, count: 128 },
  inStock: true,
  variants: [
    { id: 'v1', name: 'Small', priceModifier: 0 },
    { id: 'v2', name: 'Large', priceModifier: 10 }
  ]
}
```

## 🎨 Design Approach

### Layout Strategy
1. **Card-based Design**: Each product in a responsive card
2. **Grid System**: Bootstrap's responsive grid
3. **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform margins and padding
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information structure

### Responsiveness Considerations
1. **Mobile-First**: Designed for mobile, enhanced for desktop
2. **Flexible Images**: Maintain aspect ratio across devices
3. **Adaptive Text**: Readable on all screen sizes
4. **Touch-Friendly**: Appropriate button sizes for mobile

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- **Secondary**: White/light grays for content
- **Accents**: Success green, warning orange, danger red
- **Text**: Dark gray (#333) for readability

## 🔧 Wallet Integration

### MetaMask Connection
- Automatic detection of installed MetaMask
- Connection status indicators
- Error handling for connection failures
- Secure wallet address display

### Purchase Flow
1. User clicks "Add to Cart" without wallet → Shows "Connect Wallet"
2. User connects wallet → Button becomes active
3. User can add items to cart with wallet verification
4. Cart items include wallet address for future processing

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

### Performance Considerations
- Optimized images with proper sizing
- Lazy loading for better performance
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks
- Minimal bundle size impact

### Touch Interactions
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Smooth scroll interactions
- Gesture-friendly carousels
- Accessible navigation

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
